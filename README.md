- 👋 Hi, I’m @SamSharff

- 👀 I’m interested in ...
Civictech, govtech, public interest tech, and baseball! My background as a librarian and in social services means I'm naturally drawn well-suited to the spaces where tech intersects with the public, or directly helps the public in some capacity. I've done A LOT of work with the public troubleshooting their tech questions and seeing what works/what doesn't--it's one of the reasons I got into tech in the first place.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
I'm currently working as a teaching assistant at Actualize Bootcamp in their full stack web development program. This means I work a lot in Ruby, Rails, Vue.JS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL and more. Currently working on a resume database app for job seekers using those tools, and diving deeper into SQL. Oh, I'm also a mom, so that's a trippy 24/7 learning experience--I'm used to being schooled by my six-year-old  on exactly what I've done wrong and how I should do it next time. In that context, I would say I receive constructive criticism pretty well and reeeeeally understand the urgency of keeping your sense-of-humor 😬.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
A particular project is less important to me than a good team. I've had so many positive collaborative experiences as a TA (with the instructor, fellow TAs, and students) that range from learning Rails basics to consulting on app ideas I would never have thought of on my own. It makes me a better developer and probably a better person.

- 📫 How to reach me ...
Currently working on my personal website, so until that's finished: https://www.linkedin.com/in/samsharff/
