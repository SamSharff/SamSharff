- 👋 Hi, I’m @SamSharff

- 👀 I’m interested in ...
Civictech, govtech, public interest tech, and baseball! My background as a librarian and in social services means I'm naturally drawn well-suited to the spaces where tech intersects with the public, or directly helps the public in some capacity. I've done a lot of work with the public troubleshooting their tech questions and seeing what works/what doesn't--it's one of the reasons I got into tech in the first place.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
I'm currently working as the product coordinator at the Bloomberg Center for Public Innovation (at Johns Hopkins). Our work revolves around connecting city and commuity leaders with the resources they need to foster innovation and improve the lives of their residents. Prior to that, I worked as a teaching assistant at Actualize Bootcamp in their full stack web development program. I spent a lot of time in Ruby, Rails, Vue.JS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL and more. I went through the program myself, and my biggest project was a resume database app for job seekers using those tools. Oh, I'm also a mom, so that's a 24/7 learning experience. In that context, I would say I receive constructive criticism pretty well and reeeeeally understand the urgency of keeping your sense-of-humor 😬.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
A particular project is less important to me than a good team and supportive culture. I've had so many positive collaborative experiences--especially in my time as a TA (with the instructor, fellow TAs, and students)--that range from learning Rails basics to consulting on app ideas I would never have thought of on my own. It makes me a better communicator, developer, and probably a better person.
